  <h2>What makes Shih Tzus so great </h2>
  <p>Being cute is a way of life for this lively charmer.<br>
    The Shih Tzu is known to be especially affectionate with children.<br>
    As a small dog bred to spend most of their day inside royal palaces,<br> 
    they make a great pet if you live in an apartment or lack a big backyard.<br>
    Some dogs live to dig holes and chase cats,<br>
    but a Shih Tzu’s idea of fun is sitting in your lap acting adorable as you try to watch TV.

    join you on the couch for cuddles, and shower you with unconditional love,<br>
    this may be the dog for you.<br>
